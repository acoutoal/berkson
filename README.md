Demonstration of Berkson bias in incident cases

A simulation will demonstrate that associations between independent genetic loci that are risk factors for independent diseases will became spuriously associated with each other once we restrict the analysis to hospital cases, even if we just consider incident cases. The mechanism for this is individuals carriers of multiple risk factors are more common among incident cases.
